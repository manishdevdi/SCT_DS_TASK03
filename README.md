# SCT_DS_TASK03(Data Science Intern)
## Task03 :  Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction

This project focuses on building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Decision tree classifier to predict customer purchase behavior.
- Evaluation of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization of the decision tree.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Bank Marketing** dataset, which contains information on:

- Customer demographics (age, job, marital status, education, etc.)
- Behavioral data (contact type, previous campaign outcomes, etc.)
- Target variable: Whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit (Yes/No).
